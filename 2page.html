<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u></u>More About Coronavirus</div></h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><h2><p>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows
        and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.</p>

     <p>Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.</p></h2>
       
   <h2><p>The name "coronavirus" is derived from Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "wreath", itself a borrowing from Greek κορώνη korṓnē, "garland, wreath".[11][12] The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses.[13] The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses.[10] The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo.[10][13] This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.[14]

        The scientific name Coronavirus was accepted as a genus name by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) in 1971.[15] As the number of new species increased, the genus was split into four genera, namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus in 2009.[16] The common name coronavirus is used to refer to any member of the family Coronaviridae. As of 2020, 39 species are officially recognised.[17]</p></h2>
   <h2> <p>Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections.[46] Their sizes are highly variable and generally with an average diameter of 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known for 50 and 200 nm in diameter.[47] The total molecular size can be 40,000 kDa in an average. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules.[48] The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host</p>
   </h2>

  <h2><p> The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer, in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored.[50] The ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300.[51] The E and M protein are the structural proteins that from the viral envelope and maintaining its shape and size.[52] S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells. But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein.[53] The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron-dense shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the electron beam used to scan the virus particle).[54][52]
        
        The M protein is the main structural protein of the envelope that give the overall shape and is a type III membrane protein. It consists of 218 to 263 amino acid residues and form a layer of 7.8 nm thick.[48] It has three domains such as a short N terminal ectodomain, a triple-spanning transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal endodomain. The C-terminal domain form a matrix-like lattice that adds to the extra-thickness of the envelope. Different species can have either N- or O-linked glycans in their protein amino-terminal domain. The M protein is crucial in the life cycle of the virus such as during assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.[55]
        
        The E proteins are minor structural proteins and highly variable in different species. There are only about 20 E proteins in a coronavirus. They are 8.4 to 12 kDa in size and are composed of 76 to 109 amino acids.[47] They are integral proteins (i.e. embedded in the lipid layer) and have two domains namely transmembrane domain and extramembrane C-terminal domain. They are almost fully α-helical, with a single α-helical transmembrane domain, and forms pentameric (five-molecular) ion channels in lipid bilayers. They are responsible for virion assembly, intracellular trafficking and morphogenesis (budding).[48]
        
        The spikes are the most distinguishing feature of coronaviruses, and are responsible for the corona- or halo-like surface. On average a coronavirus particle has 74 surface spikes.[56] Each spike is about 20 nm long and is composed of a trimer of the S protein. The S protein is in turn composed of an S1 and S2 subunit. The homotrimeric S protein is a class I fusion protein which mediates the receptor binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. The S1 subunit forms the head of the spike and has the receptor binding domain (RBD). The S2 subunit forms the stem which anchors the spike in the viral envelope and on protease activation enables fusion. The two subunits remain noncovalently linked as they are exposed on the viral surface, until they attach on the host cell membrane.[48] In a functionally active state, three S1 are attached to two S2 subunits. The subunit complex is split to individual subunits when the virus binds and fuses with the host cell under the action of proteases such as cathepsin family and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of the host cell.[57]
        
        S1 proteins are the most critical components in terms of infection. They are also the most variable components as they are responsible for host cell specificity. They possess two major domains named N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), both of which serve as the receptor-binding domains. The NTDs recognise and bind sugars on the surface of the host cell. An exception is MHV NTD that binds to a protein receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). S1-CTDs are responsible for recognizing different protein receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).[48]
        
        A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).[6] The HE proteins occur as homodimers composed of about 400 amino acid residues and are 40 to 50 kDa in size. They appear as tiny surface projections of 5 to 7 nm long embedded in between the spikes. They help in attachment to and detachment from the host cell.[58]
        
        Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type conformation.[52][59] N protein is a phosphoprotein of 43 to 50 kDa in size, and is divided into three conserved domains. The majority of the protein is made up by domains 1 and 2, which are typically rich in arginines and lysines. Domain 3 a short carboxy terminal end and has a net negative charge due to excess of acidic over basic amino acid residues.[47]
