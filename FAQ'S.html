    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <u>What should I do when I get covid-19 positive?</u> </h2>
    <h2><p>If you find any symptoms of COVID-19 you have to self isolate yourself for 14 days and should not come in contact with anyone and ask the people whom you met recently to self isolate themselves also. You should even take nutrisious food and drink only hot water and plenty of fluid. If the symptoms get 
          worser or persist, you must seek medical care immediately and get tested at the nearest testing facility.  If you test possitive for covid-19, you must 
          ask the people whom you met to test themselves. Though you test positive you need not get admitted in the hospital if you have mild or no symptoms. You can 
          home isolate yourself and test yourself again when you have no symptoms.

          <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <u>How does covid 19 transmit from one person to another?</u></h2>
          <h2 style="text-align: center;">Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 spreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions. These include saliva, respiratory secretions or secretion droplets. These are released from the mouth or nose when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings, for example. People who are in close contact (within 1 metre) with an infected person can catch COVID-19 when
             those infectious droplets get into their mouth, nose or eyes.

            To avoid contact with these droplets, it is important to stay at least 1 metre away from others, clean hands frequently, and cover the mouth with a tissue or bent elbow when sneezing or coughing. When physical distancing (standing one metre or more away) is not possible, wearing a fabric mask is an important measure to protect others. Cleaning hands frequently is also critical.
