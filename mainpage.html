    <h1>What is coronavirus?</h1>
    <p>Coronavirus disease is a respiratory illness which can spread from person to person.
     It is caused due to a novel coronavirus (newly discovered strain of corona virus) which has not been previously observed in any human. 
     The disease is called as Covid-19 (‘CO’ stand for corona, ‘VI’ stands for virus, ‘D’ stands for disease and ‘19’ stands for 2019 as it was first discovered in 2019.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h1>How does covid 19 transmit from one person to another?</h1>
     <p>Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 spreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions. These include saliva, respiratory secretions or secretion droplets. 
         These are released from the mouth or nose when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings, for example. People who are in close contact (within 1 metre) with an infected person can catch COVID-19 when those infectious droplets get into their mouth, nose or eyes.
         <br>
         <br>
        To avoid contact with these droplets, it is important to stay at least 1 metre away from others, clean hands frequently, and cover the mouth with a tissue or bent elbow when sneezing or coughing. 
        When physical distancing (standing one metre or more away) is not possible, wearing a fabric mask is an important measure to protect others. Cleaning hands frequently is also critical.
